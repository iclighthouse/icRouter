# icRouter

icRouter is a token cross-chain infrastructure.


A cross-chain network of assets based on threshold signature technology, with no off-chain bridges, supporting Bitcoin, IC, and EVM networks (e.g., Ethereum).

In the past two years, a large number of cross-chain bridges have been attacked due to centralized node issues, resulting in billions of dollars in losses. 

With the development of threshold signature technology, which provides the possibility to implement asset cross-chain without off-chain bridge approach, IC Network's t-ECDSA technology has successfully implemented Bitcoin integration, which is implemented in a fully on-chain approach. This technology improves cross-chain security and reduces attack vectors.

The goal of the project is to implement a cross-chain network that enables the transfer of mainstream public chain assets to each other, supporting Bitcoin, Ethereum, IC, Polygon, Optimism, BNB Chain, and more. We use IC network as information routing and asset routing to achieve bridgeless asset cross-chaining. 

The project will implement the following features:
- Bitcoin (BTC) <> IC - (doing)
- Ethereum (ETH/ERC20) <> IC - (doing)
- IC (ICP/ICRC1) <> Ethereum
- BNB Chain (BNB/BEP20) <> IC
- Polygon (MATIC/ERC20) <> IC
- Optimism (OP/ERC20) <> IC
- Arbitrum (ARB/ERC20) <> IC
- Any Network <> Any Network
